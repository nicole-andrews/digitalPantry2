Project Background:
This project is an expansion of my very first personal project. The original version was a simple React website I built using what I learned in a UI course over the summer. 
Since then, after completing an internship in application development using Angular and taking Big Data Systems (CS 544) this semester, I wanted to push myself to build something more full-stack and robust.

Because Java is my favorite language, I decided to pivot the project to a full backend built with Java Spring Boot. 
I also wanted persistent data and the ability to run real SQL queries, so integrating PostgreSQL felt like the perfect choice. I’ve never used Spring Boot before, so there’s definitely been a learning curve, but I’m really enjoying it. 
I’m building the project with Maven, setting up REST controllers, learning how to structure a full Spring MVC application, and designing my database to support features I want to add.

I’m really excited to keep growing this project into something genuinely useful and full-featured. This has already been a great learning experience, and I can’t wait to keep iterating on it!

Project Desciption:
Digital Pantry is a full-stack application designed to help users track the food items they keep at home, manage meal ingredients, and better organize their day-to-day cooking. 

What the App Does
Digital Pantry allows users to:
- Store foods and their nutritional information (calories, protein, carbs, fat, etc.)
- Add and remove items from their personal pantry
- Log ingredients used in meals
- View macro totals for meals
- Search and filter foods from a master list
- Persist all data through a relational database
- Interact with a clean, intuitive UI built to feel like a real consumer app

The goal is to give users an easy way to track what ingredients they have, what they can cook with them, and how each meal contributes to their daily nutrition goals.
